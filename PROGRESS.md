## Recent Activity

### 2025-10-13
- âœ… Phase 0.1 Complete: Project Setup
  - Created gemspec with minimal dependencies
  - Set up lib/ and spec/ directory structure
  - Configured RSpec with SimpleCov (73% coverage)
  - Configured Rubocop with no offenses
  - All tests passing
  - Ready for Phase 1: HTTP Client

- âœ… Phase 1.1 Complete: Configuration Object
  - Created Config class with all attributes
  - Environment variable support
  - Comprehensive validation with specific error messages
  - 31 test examples for Config class
  - Coverage: 96.72%, Tests: 37 passing

- âœ… Phase 1.2 Complete: API Client Foundation
  - Created ApiClient class with Faraday
  - Basic Auth implementation (Base64 encoding)
  - Connection management with memoization
  - Custom timeout support
  - Default headers (Authorization, User-Agent, Content-Type)
  - 23 test examples for ApiClient
  - Coverage: 97.83%, Tests: 60 passing

- âœ… Phase 1.3 Complete: GET Prompt Endpoint
  - Implemented get_prompt(name, version:, label:) method
  - Added error classes (ApiError, NotFoundError, UnauthorizedError)
  - Comprehensive error handling (404, 401, 500, network errors)
  - Response parsing and validation
  - 11 new test examples with WebMock HTTP stubbing
  - Coverage: 98.31%, Tests: 71 passing

- âœ… Phase 2.1 Complete: Text Prompt Client
  - Created TextPromptClient class with Mustache templating
  - Implemented compile(variables: {}) method for variable substitution
  - Support for complex Mustache features (nested objects, conditionals, lists)
  - HTML escaping by default (security), triple braces for unescaped output
  - Metadata access (name, version, labels, tags, config)
  - 26 new test examples
  - Coverage: 98.57%, Tests: 97 passing

- âœ… Phase 2.2 Complete: Chat Prompt Client
  - Created ChatPromptClient class for chat/completion prompts
  - Implemented compile(variables: {}) method for chat messages
  - Role-based message support (system, user, assistant)
  - Variable substitution in each message independently
  - Role normalization to lowercase symbols
  - Support for Mustache features (nested objects, conditionals, lists)
  - HTML escaping by default, triple braces for unescaped output
  - 31 new test examples
  - Coverage: 98.82%, Tests: 128 passing

### 2025-10-15 (Continued)
- âœ… Phase 6 Complete: Convenience Features
  - Added compile_prompt convenience method for one-line fetch + compile
  - Implemented fallback support for graceful degradation on API errors
  - Added basic retry logic with faraday-retry (max 2 retries, exponential backoff)
  - Retries on transient errors: 429 (rate limit), 503 (service unavailable), 504 (gateway timeout)
  - 221 test examples all passing
  - Coverage: 99.63% (267/268 lines)
  - Deferred Phase 6.4 (instrumentation hooks) to post-launch as optional feature

### 2025-10-15
- âœ… Phase 4.1 Complete: Simple Caching
  - Created PromptCache class with thread-safe in-memory caching
  - TTL-based expiration with configurable max_size
  - LRU eviction when cache reaches max_size
  - Monitor-based synchronization for thread safety
  - Integrated caching into ApiClient with optional cache parameter
  - Cache key generation with support for version and label parameters
  - Methods: get, set, clear, cleanup_expired, size, empty?
  - 26 new test examples for PromptCache
  - 5 new test examples for ApiClient caching integration
  - Coverage: 99.11%, Tests: 161 passing
  - Note: Phase 3 (Variable Substitution) was already complete via Mustache integration in Phase 2

- âœ… Phase 5 Complete: Global Config & Singleton Client
  - Created Client class as main entry point for the SDK
  - Client wraps ApiClient and returns appropriate prompt clients (Text/Chat)
  - Automatic cache creation based on Config settings (cache_ttl, cache_max_size)
  - Detects prompt type from API response and returns TextPromptClient or ChatPromptClient
  - Global Langfuse.configure block pattern fully functional
  - Global Langfuse.client singleton pattern with memoization
  - Langfuse.reset! for testing (clears configuration and client)
  - 21 new test examples for Client class
  - 5 new test examples for global Langfuse module patterns
  - Coverage: 99.6%, Tests: 187 passing

## Next Steps

**See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md) for the updated roadmap.**

### Phase 6: Convenience Features (Next)
- Compile convenience method (one-liner fetch + compile)
- Fallback support for graceful degradation
- Basic retry logic with faraday-retry
- Optional instrumentation hooks (ActiveSupport::Notifications)

### Future Phases (Post-Launch)
- Phase 7: Advanced Caching (Redis/Rails.cache as optional backend)
- Phase 8: CRUD Operations (create/update prompts)
- Phase 9: LangChain Integration
- Phase 10: Polish & 1.0 Release
- Phase 11: CI/CD & Automation

## Decisions Log

**2025-10-15 - Roadmap Simplification**
- **Decision**: Created IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md with simplified roadmap
- **Context**: Original IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md evolved toward Rails/Redis-specific architecture, but we built a simpler, more portable solution
- **What We Built**: In-memory PromptCache with Monitor synchronization (thread-safe, no external deps)
- **Future Plans**: Redis/distributed caching moved to Phase 7 as optional feature for high-scale deployments
- **Benefit**: Gem works great for most use cases without requiring Redis. Can scale up later if needed.
- **Note**: Old plan preserved as IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for reference
