  - Comprehensive design document created (docs/STALE_WHILE_REVALIDATE_DESIGN.md)
  - Thread pool sizing analysis: 5 threads handles 100+ prompts
  - Trade-offs documented: complexity vs marginal latency improvement
  - Decision: Defer implementation - Phase 7.1 + 7.2 provide excellent performance
  - Can revisit if P99 latency becomes a production issue

## Next Steps

**See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md) for the updated roadmap.**

### Next Phase
- Phase 10: Polish & 1.0 Release (YARD docs, performance benchmarks, publish to RubyGems)

### Optional/Future Phases
- Phase 6.4: Instrumentation Hooks (ActiveSupport::Notifications for observability)
- Phase 7: Advanced Caching (Redis/Rails.cache as optional backend for high-scale deployments)

### Not Needed
- Phase 8: CRUD Operations (create/update prompts) - Not relevant to current use case
- Phase 9: LangChain Integration (to_langchain methods) - Not using langchain-rb

## Decisions Log

**2025-10-15 - Roadmap Simplification**
- **Decision**: Created IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md with simplified roadmap
- **Context**: Original IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md evolved toward Rails/Redis-specific architecture, but we built a simpler, more portable solution
- **What We Built**: In-memory PromptCache with Monitor synchronization (thread-safe, no external deps)
- **Future Plans**: Redis/distributed caching moved to Phase 7 as optional feature for high-scale deployments
- **Benefit**: Gem works great for most use cases without requiring Redis. Can scale up later if needed.
- **Note**: Old plan preserved as IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for reference

**2025-10-16 - CI/CD Complete, CRUD and LangChain Not Needed**
- **Decision**: Phase 11 (CI/CD) marked complete, Phases 8 & 9 marked as not needed
- **Context**: GitHub Actions workflow already in place with multi-version testing and linting
- **CRUD Not Needed**: Create/update prompt operations not relevant to current use case
- **LangChain Not Needed**: Not using langchain-rb framework, working with LLM APIs directly
- **Next Phase**: Phase 10 (Polish & 1.0 Release) - final documentation and gem publication

**2025-10-16 - Phase 7.3 (Stale-While-Revalidate) Deferred**
- **Decision**: Document SWR design but defer implementation
- **Context**: Phase 7.1 (Rails.cache) + 7.2 (stampede protection) already provide excellent performance
- **Analysis**: Stampede protection ensures only 1 API call per cache miss (not 1,200)
- **Trade-off**: SWR adds complexity (thread pool, concurrent-ruby dependency, metadata storage) for marginal latency benefit
- **Current Performance**: 100ms latency hit happens very infrequently (once per TTL window)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive design doc created at docs/STALE_WHILE_REVALIDATE_DESIGN.md
- **When to Reconsider**: If P99 latency becomes a production issue, or Langfuse API slows significantly (>500ms)
- **Next**: Consider Phase 7.4 (cache warming) as simpler alternative for deployment scenarios
