- ✅ YARD documentation on all public APIs
- ✅ Usage examples for text and chat prompts
- ✅ Configuration and caching guides
- ✅ Tracing Guide (docs/TRACING.md)
- ✅ Rails Integration Guide (docs/RAILS.md)
- ✅ Migration Guide (docs/MIGRATION.md)

### Phase 10: Polish & 1.0 Release (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Complete YARD documentation (verified)

## Future Phases (Post-Launch)

### Phase 6.4: Instrumentation Hooks (Optional)
*Deferred to post-launch*

Add ActiveSupport::Notifications integration for observability:
- Event emission for get_prompt operations
- Payload includes: name, duration, cache_hit, fallback_used
- Optional feature, only active if ActiveSupport is defined

### Phase 7: Advanced Caching (Optional)
*For users who need Redis/distributed caching*

- Background cache refresh (stale-while-revalidate)
- Rails.cache adapter (Redis backend)
- Distributed stampede protection
- Cache warming utilities

**Note:** In-memory cache works great for most apps. This is for high-scale deployments.

### Phase 8: CRUD Operations (NOT NEEDED)
*Not relevant to current use case*

- ~~`create_prompt(name, prompt, type:, **options)`~~
- ~~`update_prompt(name, prompt, **options)`~~
- ~~Cache invalidation on updates~~
- ~~VCR for testing~~

### Phase 9: LangChain Integration (NOT NEEDED)
*Not using langchain-rb framework*

- ~~`TextPromptClient#to_langchain`~~
- ~~`ChatPromptClient#to_langchain`~~
- ~~Handle variable transformation~~
- ~~Write integration examples~~

## Design Decisions

### Why In-Memory Cache First?
**Decision:** Built simple, thread-safe in-memory cache instead of Redis

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Zero external dependencies (works everywhere)
- ✅ Fast and simple for most use cases
- ✅ Perfect for single-process apps, scripts, Sidekiq workers
- ✅ Easy to test and debug
- 🔄 Can add Redis as optional backend later (Phase 7)

**Trade-offs:**
- Each process has its own cache (not shared)
- Cache cleared on restart
- Not ideal for 1000+ process deployments

**For large deployments:** Phase 7 will add Redis support as an optional backend.

### Architecture Patterns
**Following LaunchDarkly:**
- Flat API (all methods on Client)
- Global configuration with `Langfuse.configure`
- Singleton pattern with `Langfuse.client`
- Keyword arguments everywhere
- Minimal dependencies (add only what's needed)

## Current Dependencies

**Runtime:**
- `faraday ~> 2.0` - HTTP client
- `faraday-retry ~> 2.0` - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- `mustache ~> 1.1` - Variable substitution

**Development:**
- `rspec` - Testing
- `rubocop` + `rubocop-rspec` - Linting
- `simplecov` - Coverage
- `webmock` - HTTP stubbing

---

## Test Coverage Target

- **Current:** 99.63% (267/268 lines) - 221 tests
- **Target:** > 95% for 1.0 release
- **Status:** ✅ Exceeding target!
